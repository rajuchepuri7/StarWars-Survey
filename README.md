# StarWars-Survey

In this project, we'll be working with Jupyter notebook and analyzing data on the Star Wars movies.

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which you download from [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).

For this project, we will be cleaning and exploring the data set in Jupyter notebook.
